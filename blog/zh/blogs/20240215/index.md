ZLUDA once lets you run unmodified CUDA applications on Intel devices. Several days ago, it introduces an explosive update, and now it only supports AMD.

For me, the most exciting part would be the more complete [CUDA dark api](https://github.com/vosen/ZLUDA/blob/master/zluda_dark_api/src/lib.rs). 
Great advances have been reached compared with three years ago, when Vosen announce stopping working on this project. More inner CUDA calls are reversed and revealed to the public.

Other related projects I'm tracking:
- https://github.com/gvirtus/GVirtuS (After three years, it updates recently, too!)
- https://github.com/google/gvisor/issues/14 (Track the GPU support proposal for gVisor.)
